# **Predicting Incident Resolution Time App**

### **Mission:**
The goal of this application is to predict the time it takes to resolve cybersecurity incidents based on historical threat data. By doing so, organizations can:

- **Assess incident resolution efficiency**
- **Optimize resource allocation** for incident handling
- **Anticipate future cybersecurity challenges**
- **Enhance response strategies** through data-driven insights

### **Dataset Description:**

**Source:** [Global Cybersecurity Threats (2015-2024) Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-cybersecurity-threats-2015-2024)

This dataset contains information about cybersecurity incidents with several key features that can be used to predict incident resolution times.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Threat Type:** Type of cybersecurity threat
- **Incident Category:** Category of the incident (e.g., Phishing, Ransomware, etc.)
- **Year:** Year of the incident (2015-2024)
- **Incident Duration:** Time taken to resolve the incident (target variable)
- **Incident Severity:** Severity level of the incident (scale)
- **Response Time:** Initial response time to the incident
- **Resources Allocated:** Resources used to resolve the incident

---

### **Analysis Objectives:**

- **Analyze the factors** that affect cybersecurity incident resolution times.
- **Build predictive models** to estimate the resolution time for future incidents.
- **Assist organizations** in improving their incident response strategies and efficiency.
